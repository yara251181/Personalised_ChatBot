# Personalised_ChatBot
Personalized ChatBot using Llama 2 Model
This project involves developing a personalized ChatBot using the Llama 2 model from Hugging Face, implemented in Python. The ChatBot is fine-tuned on client-specific data to provide real-time information and enhance user interaction with the data.

Libraries Used
Transformers: Utilized to import and use the Llama 2 model from Hugging Face.
Streamlit: Used to create a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the ChatBot.
PromptTemplate: Used to create and manage the prompts for the ChatBot.
Other Python Libraries: Additional libraries such as pandas, numpy, etc., as required for data handling and processing.


Project Features
Model Fine-Tuning:

Fine-tuned the Llama 2 model on client-specific data to improve the relevance and accuracy of the responses.
Used the Hugging Face transformers library to import and fine-tune the model.
User Interface:

Created a simple and intuitive web interface using streamlit.
Allows users to input queries and receive real-time responses from the ChatBot.
Prompt Management:

Utilized PromptTemplate to design and manage prompts for the ChatBot.
Ensured the prompts are dynamic and adaptable to various user inputs.
